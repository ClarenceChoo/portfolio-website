            <h3>Bill Splitter</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This intuitive web application, built with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, simplifies the process of dividing expenses among a
                group of people. Each person only has to pay for the food they
                eat, making it easy to split the bill fairly and accurately. It
                also includes a tax % feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                The inspiration came about when my friends and I were dining
                out, but each of us had different dietiary restrictions. There
                are also dishes that we shared, hence each dish was shared by a
                different number of people.
              </li>
              <li>
                To make it fair, we tried calculating based on who ate which
                dishes since some of the dishes cost significantly more than
                others. In the end, it took over an hour just to settle the
                bill.
              </li>
              <li>
                It was then i thought of this idea of creating a web application
                to improve the efficiency of handling situations like this.
